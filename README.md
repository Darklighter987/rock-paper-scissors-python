# Rock-paper-scissors-python-game
My first python project! A Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game using functions and user input. Includes debugging improvements.
## What I learned:
Used functions to structure the game
Debugged and fixed issues including:
Corrected indentation of `if __name__ == "__main__"` (it was inside a function). 
Fixed missing parentheses when calling `get_computer_choice()`.
Practiced writing clean and readable python code.
## how to run the code
Clone "possibly_fixed.py" or "fixed.py"
run "possily_fixed.py" or "fixed.py" in a terminal I ran this on VS Code
